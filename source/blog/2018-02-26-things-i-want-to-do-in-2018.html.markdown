This year's post comes a little bit later since I decided to wait a month and filter ~~all~~ some of the stupid stuff I
came up with.

## The list

~~In no particular order. I guess I'll assign some priorities when I'm done with thinking up things.~~

I don't think I ever managed to assign priorities to this list.

#. ~~Go to Japan~~ - already booked my tickets so there's no retreat
#. Read 52 books
    #. Yoshiki Tanaka - Legend of the Galactic Heroes: Mobilization
    #. Takeshi Matsuyama - Amaryllis in the Ice Country
#. [Watch 52 things from my backlog](https://www.facebook.com/events/497685500618509/permalink/497687770618282/).
#. Read 6 visual novels (at least one has to be in Japanese)
    #. Chaos;Child
    #. The Shadows of Pygmalion
    #. Chuusotsu! 1st graduation
    #. Super Dangan Ronpa 2 Sayonara Zetsubou Gakuen
#. ~~Finish reading Bartender~~
#. Finish (at least) the following games:
    #. The Legend of Heroes: Trails in the Sky the 3rd
    #. The Legend of Heroes: Trails of Cold Steel I and II
#. ~~Start my own business~~ - postponed to after my masters degree since doesn't make financial sense before
#. Try my hand at writing reviews

I'll probably add more since I'm going at a pretty good pace and for once I might acutally do everything this year.
