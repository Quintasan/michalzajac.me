Some time ago (June I guess?) I found myself interested in bartending. I most likely don't measure up to professional
bartender, nevertheless I decided to experiment a little bit and came up with a simple but eye-catching cocktail.
I present you - Gold Experience.

### Gold Experience

Serve in a champagne flute.

  * 20ml Danziger Goldwasser
  * Top with champagne

Definitely do separate the gold floating in the Goldwasser so that you can add as much of gold flakes as you want.
Pour the Goldwasser into chilled champagne flute and top it up with champagne. Finish by adding a spoon of gold flakes
on top.

And yes, the name is a reference to a Stand from JoJo's Bizarre Adventure.
